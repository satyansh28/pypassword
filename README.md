# pypassword
[My first app :) ]A secure password checking app which uses the API provided by "https://haveibeenpwned.com/" but does not send your password over the internet to any website server(because that's not really secure!).It uses tkinter for the GUI!

Instructions for use:
Just clone the repository and run main.py using python.
